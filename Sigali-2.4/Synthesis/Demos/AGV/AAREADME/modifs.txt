/** \page note Some modifications

   You can modify the file vt.z3z to accelerate the "sigali compiling" by
      - replacing the line  (after the declare( ) area )
        \verbatim
              Tick : C1 ^2;
        \endverbatim
        by
        \verbatim
	       Tick: 1 ;
        \endverbatim

      - and reporting this definition as a constraint in ("constraints" area), 
        \verbatim
	    C1 ^2 = Tick,
        \endverbatim
        you will have the following lines
        \verbatim
             constraints: [
                C1 ^2 = Tick,
                C2 ^2 = Tick,
                C3 ^2 = Tick,
                ...
        \endverbatim



 This basically  says that at  each instant, all  the input events  are present.
 Otherwise, during the  simulation, <b> the automatic mode of simulation will most of
 the time choose the input events to be absent</b>.
