/** \page note Some modifications

   You can modify the file vt.z3z to accelerate the "sigali compiling" by
      - replacing the line  (after the declare( ) area )
        \verbatim
               CLK_d_normal : d_normal ^2;
        \endverbatim
        by
        \verbatim
	       CLK_d_normal : 1;
        \endverbatim

      - and reporting this definition as a constraint in ("constraints" area), 
        \verbatim
	        Mvt_Mouse_1 ^2 = CLK_Mvt_Mouse_1,
        \endverbatim
        you will have the following lines
        \verbatim
              constraints: [
                   d_normal ^2 = CLK_d_normal ,
                   d_run ^2 = CLK_d_normal,
                   d_stuck ^2 = CLK_d_normal,
                   ...
        \endverbatim


 This basically  says that at  each instant, all  the input events  are present.
 Otherwise, during the  simulation, <b> the automatic mode of simulation will most of
 the time choose the input events to be absent</b>.
